# APIs

The Blink's APIs can be developed using numerous programming language and technologies. The current and stable implementation is written in NodeJs. 
There's no official documentation on how to use or write them yet, so the only way to understand them is inspecting the source code or open "BlinkApiUsageExample.json" with Insomnia to have a clearer look at them.
