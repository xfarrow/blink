# APIs

The Blink's APIs can be developed using numerous programming language and technologies. The current and stable implementation is written in NodeJs. 
There's no official documentation on how to use or write them yet, so the only way to understand them is inspecting the source code or open "BlinkApiUsageExample.json" with Insomnia to have a clearer look at them.

## Correctness
We want endpoints to be always correct, independently of the content and the timing of the requests. You're invited to analyze the code and write unit tests.
