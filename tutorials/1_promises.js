/*
    The function passed to Promise is called "executor". When Promise gets
    created, the executor gets executed.
    When the Promise ends, it should either call the "resolve" or "reject"
    callbacks:
    resolve(value) — if the job is finished successfully, with result value.
    reject(error) — if an error has occurred, error is the error object.

    Remember that Promises are not intrensically asyncronous
