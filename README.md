If you're a developer you can either set up your own infrastructure, or just set up a front-end using another instance's APIs. Consult the Wiki for further details.

## How to show your support
This software is free, embodying both the principles of 'free' as in 'free beer' and 'free' as in 'free speech'. However, this does not come free of costs for the author(s). Therefore, your invaluable cooperation would be greatly appreciated. For instance, you could:
* Help us spread the word 📢
* Show your support by starring us on GitHub 🌟
* Improve the code 💻
* Contribute financially to our efforts on [Ko-Fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/xfarrow). However, we kindly request this only if you have already contributed to more critical [humanitarian causes](https://donare.info/en/welcome).
