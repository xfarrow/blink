## What is it?
Blink is a privacy-respecting business-oriented social media platform focused on fostering connections between businesses and individuals, propelling careers and sparking innovation in the professional world.

Think of it as an open-source alternative to LinkedIn.

## Usage
If you're an individual you can use one of the available instances.
If you're a developer you can either set up your own infrastructure, or just set up a front-end using another instance's APIs. Consult the Wiki for further details. **The wiki is not written yet**
